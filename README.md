## Submissions
Before adding test cases, follow this procedure so that the master branch doesn't get corrupted:
1. Check which branch you're currently on (`git branch`). A star will indicate which branch you're on.
2. If you're on a branch other than master, checkout to master (`git checkout master`)
3. Pull the most updated verison of master before adding your test cases (`git pull origin master`)
4. Checkout a branch for the case(s) you want to add (`git checkout -b [test-case]`)
5. Add your test cases(s) to the README.
6. Add and commit your changes.
7. Push that branch, not to master (`git push [test-case]`)
8. Open a pull request on Github.
9. Slack the sf-0517 channel with the link to the pull request and have someone merge to master for you.
